iOS Style Notification Badges for WordPress

== Description ==

Badged transforms the standard WordPress update & comment notification badges into iOS-styled ones.

The badges are CSS only and were tested in current versions of Safari, Chrome & Firefox. It should degrade gracefully in older Browsers with some details missing like drop shadows or the highlight shine.


== Installation ==

Just install, activate and enjoy the red badges:

1. Upload the badged plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy

(optional) Adjust options under Settings > Badges

1. Restyled notifications in Toolbar
2. Restyled notifications in Admin Menu
3. Settings page
